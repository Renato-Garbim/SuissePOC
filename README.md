Some insights:
I could add easily a test layer
I didnt put an application layer properly cause i would like to do with a Mapper to make things better it would take a little more time.
Its was implemented an IOC and a Repository Layer that can connect to any DAL, the one i put it in it was just to mock the work and the pattern.

Question 2:

Just add the new property to the entity Trade them insert the new category in the Enum, modify the method in the service to reflect this new Business Rule
to make it work.
